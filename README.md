## Supporting Folder 1: MaxQuant Results

Due to the size of MaxQuant tables, many of them are not present in this GitHub repository. However, we do include the summary.txt file, which includes acquisition information for each .raw file used in these experiments, and parameters.txt, which includes the database search parameters. The remaining MaxQuant output tables can be found at the publishers website. 

## Supporting Folder 2: Data Analysis

This manuscript uses Python 3.8.10 for data analysis and visualisation, with the following dependencies: matplotlib 3.3.2, SciPy 1.7.3, pandas 1.2.3, NumPy 1.19.2, Biopython 1.78, matplotlib-venn 0.11.6. The data analysis scripts used to generate figures are provided in this folder. 

## Supporting Tables 1-6

These supporting tables contain all the data after analysis. These tables are separated based on the overlap between BOOST experiments and their corresponding controls. 

## Supporting Information

The supporting_information.pdf file contains the Supporting Figures and legends for the Supporting Tables and Folders.
