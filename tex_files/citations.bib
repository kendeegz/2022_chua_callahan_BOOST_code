    abstract = {The SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) plays a critical scaffolding role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. As an adaptor protein that contains multiple protein-binding domains, SLP-76 interacts with many signaling molecules and links proximal receptor stimulation to downstream effectors. The function of SLP-76 in TCR signaling has been widely studied using the Jurkat human leukaemic T cell line through protein disruption or site-directed mutagenesis. However, a wide-scale characterization of SLP-76-dependant phosphorylation events is still lacking. Quantitative profiling of over a hundred tyrosine phosphorylation sites revealed new modes of regulation of phosphorylation of PAG, PI3K, and WASP while reconfirming previously established regulation of Itk, PLCγ, and Erk phosphorylation by SLP-76. The absence of SLP-76 also perturbed the phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) Lck and Fyn, and subsequently a large number of SFK-regulated signaling molecules. Altogether our data suggests unique modes of regulation of positive and negative feedback pathways in T cells by SLP-76, reconfirming its central role in the pathway.},

    abstract = { Receptor pathway analysis informs structural modifications to CAR T cells that improve their function. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were designed to mimic activated endogenous T cell receptors (TCRs) and induce a cytotoxic response to tumor antigen. However, CARs require more antigen than TCRs for activation, thereby causing treatment exclusion or failure and relapse in many patients. To design CARs with a lower activation threshold, Salter et al. compared antigen-induced pathway signaling in human T cells expressing a current CAR construct to that in cells with endogenous TCRs. The analysis informed the design of new CARs that more robustly activated a T cell co-receptor and an adaptor, resulting in CAR T cells that more effectively responded to low antigen density tumor cells in culture and decreased tumor burden and mortality in mice. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–modified T cell therapy is effective in treating lymphomas, leukemias, and multiple myeloma in which the tumor cells express high amounts of target antigen. However, achieving durable remission for these hematological malignancies and extending CAR T cell therapy to patients with solid tumors will require receptors that can recognize and eliminate tumor cells with a low density of target antigen. Although CARs were designed to mimic T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, TCRs are at least 100-fold more sensitive to antigen. To design a CAR with improved antigen sensitivity, we directly compared TCR and CAR signaling in primary human T cells. Global phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that key T cell signaling proteins—such as CD3δ, CD3ε, and CD3γ, which comprise a portion of the T cell co-receptor, as well as the TCR adaptor protein LAT—were either not phosphorylated or were only weakly phosphorylated by CAR stimulation. Modifying a commonplace 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR sequence to better engage CD3ε and LAT using embedded CD3ε or GRB2 domains resulted in enhanced T cell activation in vitro in settings of a low density of antigen, and improved efficacy in in vivo models of lymphoma, leukemia, and breast cancer. These CARs represent examples of alterations in receptor design that were guided by in-depth interrogation of T cell signaling. }

    abstract = { The total length of CAR intracellular domains determines interactions with endogenous proteins to promote TCR signaling. B cell malignancies can be therapeutically targeted by the adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). In T cells, CARs that encode specific signaling domains have unique functional responses to antigen recognition. Ramello et al. used immunoproteomics to understand how CARs with distinct intracellular domains activated signaling in human T cells. Independently of specific signaling domains, the overall length of CAR intracellular activation domains determined whether a CAR interacted with the signaling protein CD3ζ and promoted strong T cell signaling. These data may explain why some CARs can stimulate antigen-independent tonic signaling, which leads to progressive CAR-T cell inactivation. Adoptive transfer of T cells that express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is an approved immunotherapy that may be curative for some hematological cancers. To better understand the therapeutic mechanism of action, we systematically analyzed CAR signaling in human primary T cells by mass spectrometry. When we compared the interactomes and the signaling pathways activated by distinct CAR-T cells that shared the same antigen-binding domain but differed in their intracellular domains and their in vivo antitumor efficacy, we found that only second-generation CARs induced the expression of a constitutively phosphorylated form of CD3ζ that resembled the endogenous species. This phenomenon was independent of the choice of costimulatory domains, or the hinge/transmembrane region. Rather, it was dependent on the size of the intracellular domains. Moreover, the second-generation design was also associated with stronger phosphorylation of downstream secondary messengers, as evidenced by global phosphoproteome analysis. These results suggest that second-generation CARs can activate additional sources of CD3ζ signaling, and this may contribute to more intense signaling and superior antitumor efficacy that they display compared to third-generation CARs. Moreover, our results provide a deeper understanding of how CARs interact physically and/or functionally with endogenous T cell molecules, which will inform the development of novel optimized immune receptors. }
